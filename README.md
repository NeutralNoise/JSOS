# JSOS

## What is it?
JSOS is a homemade operating system that is just a way to learn how Operating systems work. That's all its not really production ready and it really don't think its useable for anything else other then learning.

## Where did you learn how to do this?
There are a number of sources where you can learn how to do this kind of thing. Its not easy and its recommended that you have a very large understanding of C/C++ or of the selected lanuage that you wish to use to make your operating system in.

Here are some sources that I used.
1. [OS dev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)
2. [Github Write your own operating system](https://github.com/AlgorithMan-de/wyoos) (I can't get onto the website anymore.)

There are a lot more out there you just have to find them! These are the main ones that I used.

## You seem to be implamenting the C standard lidary and not the C++ one why?
Baby steps first ok.

## What does the future hold for this?
See [TODO](TODO.md). But other then that probly nothing.

## You seem to be taking your sweet time working on this.
I work on this when I either get a brain wave or just feel like messing around with some really low level stuff. I have other things that I work on so this gets little to no work done.

## How do I compile and run this?
See [COMPILE](COMPILE.md). If you have to ask the second part of this question maybe you should rethink what you really want out of life. But that being said you just use a VM. Personally I use Virtual Box.

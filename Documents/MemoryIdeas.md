# Memory TODO

Just some ideas about how to improve memory management. Some might be good some not so good but hay I'm learning here.

1. Have the memory page size change
Have a base size for a memory page. But if the size is of the memory chunk is bigger then the page just make it larger then when its freed change the size.

2. Virtual memory space.
This needs to be looked into a little not to sure how this work 100% but I think for now it can be skipped.

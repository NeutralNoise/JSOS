# Memory TODO

The current memory paging system is so wrong its not funny. Its going to be
removed and reimplamented later after some of the other things on the todo list
are complete.

The current system does not use the [MMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit) at all like it should.
